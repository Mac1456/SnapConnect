# Group Chat Fixes Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Database Schema Issues
**Problem**: The app was trying to query a `group_messages` table that didn't exist.
**Solution**: 
- Created proper `group_chats` table
- Modified `messages` table to support group messages with `group_chat_id` column
- Made `recipient_id` nullable for group messages
- Added proper constraints to ensure data integrity

### 2. Foreign Key Relationship Errors
**Problem**: Supabase couldn't find relationships between tables.
**Solution**: 
- Fixed table references in queries
- Updated all queries to use the `messages` table instead of `group_messages`
- Added proper foreign key relationships

### 3. NOT NULL Constraint Violation
**Problem**: Group messages were failing because `recipient_id` was required but should be null for group messages.
**Solution**: 
- Made `recipient_id` nullable in messages table
- Added constraint to ensure either `recipient_id` OR `group_chat_id` is set (not both)
- Updated insert queries to explicitly set `recipient_id` to null for group messages

### 4. Supabase Client Import Issues
**Problem**: GroupChatScreen was importing supabase client from wrong location.
**Solution**: Fixed import to use correct path: `'../../supabase.config'`

## Files Modified

### Database Schema Files
1. **`supabase-schema.sql`** - Added group_chats table and updated messages table
2. **`supabase-group-chat-fixes.sql`** - Comprehensive migration file with all fixes

### Application Code Files
1. **`src/stores/groupChatStore.js`** - Fixed query table names and message sending logic
2. **`src/screens/GroupChatScreen.js`** - Fixed supabase import path

## Database Migration Required

**IMPORTANT**: You must run the SQL migration to fix the database schema.

### Step 1: Apply Database Fixes
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-group-chat-fixes.sql`
4. Execute the SQL to apply all fixes

### Step 2: Verify the Migration
The SQL includes a status message at the end. You should see:
```
Group chat functionality has been fixed successfully!
```

## What the Fixes Include

### Database Structure
- ✅ `group_chats` table with proper structure
- ✅ Updated `messages` table for group support
- ✅ Proper indexes for performance
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ✅ Realtime subscriptions enabled

### Helper Functions
- ✅ `leave_group_chat()` - Safely remove users from groups
- ✅ `add_group_members()` - Add multiple members at once
- ✅ `remove_group_member()` - Admin-only member removal

### Application Logic
- ✅ Fixed table references (messages instead of group_messages)
- ✅ Proper null handling for group message recipient_id
- ✅ Corrected import paths
- ✅ Enhanced error handling and logging

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Group Chat Creation
- ✅ Users can create new group chats
- ✅ Creator is automatically set as admin
- ✅ Members are properly added to member_ids array

### Message Sending
- ✅ Group messages save correctly with null recipient_id
- ✅ Messages include group_chat_id and group_members
- ✅ Real-time updates work for all group members

### Group Management
- ✅ Add/remove members (admin only)
- ✅ Leave group functionality
- ✅ Proper member list fetching
- ✅ Group settings and member details display

### Real-time Features
- ✅ Live message updates
- ✅ Group membership changes
- ✅ Proper subscription cleanup

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Create a Group**: Test group creation with multiple members
2. **Send Messages**: Verify messages appear for all members
3. **Add Members**: Test adding new members to existing groups
4. **Leave Group**: Test the leave functionality
5. **Real-time**: Test with multiple devices/browsers

## Troubleshooting

If you still see errors after applying the migration:

1. **Check Database Migration**: Ensure all SQL in `supabase-group-chat-fixes.sql` executed successfully
2. **Verify Tables**: Confirm `group_chats` table exists and `messages` table has `group_chat_id` column
3. **Check Policies**: Ensure RLS policies are properly created
4. **Restart App**: Clear cache and restart the development server

## Notes

- All existing direct messages will continue to work
- Group messages and direct messages use the same `messages` table
- RLS policies ensure users can only see messages they're authorized to view
- Helper functions provide safe ways to modify group membership
